# Git Workshop

You can find the slides from the Git workshop here. And this is also where you will be submitting your Pull Request.

## Ready to submit your PR?
As a part of the workshop, we asked you to make your first open source contribution by submitting a Pull Request here.
If you are unsure what a PR is, or you haven't attended the workshop, we recommend that you go back and review the slides.

Before submitting your PR, take a moment to consider what you have learnt and accomplished so far.
You know how Git works and you have Git in your arsenal for using it with your projects. It's a really powerful tool.
You also know how to collaborate with your team using Git.

That's a lot of stuff there! So congratulations on coming so far, and good luck with your PR!
